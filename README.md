# Betting_DAPP
A little betting game using a DAPP to operate.


The goal of this DAPP is to allow players to bet an ETH amount on the DAPP, which will give randomly a success or fail answer to the player.

- If he won, he will have his bet amount doubled.
- If he lose, the DAPP's smart-contract will keep the bet amount of the player.

Also, the DAPP only work with a first deposit from the player - before he bet - on the smart-contract adress.
